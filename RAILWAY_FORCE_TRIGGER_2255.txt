RAILWAY FORCE UPDATE - 2025-07-12T22:55:00Z
GitHub Sync Issue - Creating new commit to trigger Railway

Changes:
- Updated Dockerfile comment to force new build
- Enhanced rpa_bot_cloud.py with full Multilogin integration
- Fixed token retrieval from Supabase Edge Functions
- Added comprehensive action support (screenshot, navigate, click, type)

This should trigger a new Railway deployment with the correct RPA bot version.
